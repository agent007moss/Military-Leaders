# Duty Roster Module (Skeleton)

This directory contains placeholder scaffolding for the **duty_roster** feature box.

- `models.py`: Pydantic models with a generic `data` field only.
- `schemas.py`: Thin create/read DTOs with no real validation.
- `api.py`: FastAPI router exposing non-functional list/create/example routes.

Actual business rules, validation, and data contracts will be added in later
implementation threads.
