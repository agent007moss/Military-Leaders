# Backend Skeleton (Phase 1)

This backend is a non-functional scaffold for the Military Leaders Tool.

- FastAPI entrypoint in `main.py`
- Core configuration in `app/core`
- Feature modules in `app/modules`
- Services (notifications, sync, etc.) in `app/services`

No persistence, authentication, or business rules are implemented yet.
All routers, models, and schemas are minimal placeholders ready to be
filled in during later implementation threads.
